# DJ Booking Blueprint - Complete Written Course Scripts

## **Module 1: The Professional First Impression System**
### *"Why 90% of DJs Never Get Past the Email"*

---

**Welcome to Your DJ Booking Transformation**

If you're reading this, you're already ahead of 90% of DJs who think talent alone will get them booked. Here's the harsh reality: I know bedroom producers with incredible skills who've never played outside their apartment, and I know average DJs pulling $2,000+ per weekend because they understand what you're about to learn.

The difference? Professional communication.

**The Email That Changed Everything**

Let me tell you about Marcus, a house DJ from Miami. For two years, he sent emails like this:

*"Hey, I'm a really good DJ and I play house music. I've been DJing for 5 years and have all my own equipment. Can I play at your club?"*

Response rate? Zero.

Then he learned the system I'm about to teach you. His first email using this method got him a callback within 6 hours. Within 3 months, he was a regular at three South Beach venues.

**Why Most DJ Emails Get Deleted**

Before we fix your approach, let's understand why promoters and venue managers delete 95% of DJ emails:

1. **Generic messaging** - Shows you didn't research their venue
2. **Focused on you, not them** - They don't care about your passion
3. **No proof you can pack a floor** - They need butts in seats
4. **Unprofessional presentation** - Looks like amateur hour
5. **No clear next step** - They don't know how to respond

**The 3-Part Professional Email Formula**

Here's the exact template that's generated over $500,000 in bookings for DJs I've coached:

**PART 1: The Research Hook (Subject Line + Opening)**

Subject Line Formula: "Available [SPECIFIC DATE] - [YOUR DJ NAME] - [THEIR GENRE] Specialist"

Example: "Available March 15th - DJ Sarah K - Tech House Specialist"

Opening Sentence: Reference something specific about their venue that shows you've done homework.

**Good Examples:**
- "I was at LIV last Saturday during Steve's 1-3am set and loved how the crowd responded when he transitioned from progressive to tech house around 1:30am."
- "Saw the photos from your Saturday Latin night - the energy looked incredible when the bachata section hit around midnight."
- "Your resident DJ Alex has incredible track selection - especially how he builds energy during those crucial 10pm-11pm hours."

**Bad Examples:**
- "I love your club"
- "You guys throw great parties"
- "I've heard good things about your venue"

**PART 2: The Value Proposition (What's In It For Them)**

This is where most DJs mess up. They talk about themselves instead of solving the venue's problems.

**Venue Problems You Can Solve:**
- Empty dance floor during warm-up hours (9pm-11pm)
- Crowd energy dies during transitions
- Need reliable DJs for last-minute bookings
- Want DJs who bring their own audience
- Need someone who understands their demographic

**Value Proposition Templates:**

*For Warm-up Slots:*
"I specialize in building energy during those crucial 10pm-11pm hours when most DJs struggle to get people dancing. My track selection and mixing style consistently gets crowds moving before the headliner takes over."

*For Peak Hours:*
"I excel at reading crowds and adapting my set in real-time to keep the energy high. My last three club performances maintained packed floors for 2+ hours straight with zero crowd drop-off."

*For Reliability:*
"I understand the business side - I arrive early, come prepared with backup equipment, and focus on keeping your customers happy and buying drinks all night."

**PART 3: The Easy Yes (Clear Call to Action)**

Make it simple for them to say yes:

"I've attached a 15-minute mix that matches your venue's vibe from last Saturday night. Would you be open to a 5-minute call this week to discuss your upcoming March dates?"

**Alternative CTAs:**
- "Are you free for a quick coffee this week to discuss potential collaboration?"
- "Would you like me to come by during your next event to introduce myself?"
- "I have March 15th and 22nd available - would either date work for a trial run?"

**The Complete Email Template:**

---

**Subject:** Available March 15th - DJ Sarah K - Tech House Specialist

**Body:**
Hi Marcus,

I was at LIV last Saturday during Steve's 1-3am set and loved how the crowd responded when he transitioned from progressive to tech house around 1:30am. The energy in that room was electric.

I specialize in building energy during those crucial 10pm-11pm hours when most DJs struggle to get people dancing. My track selection and mixing style consistently gets crowds moving before the headliner takes over. I've maintained warm-up residencies at three South Beach venues and regularly deliver packed floors by 11pm.

I've attached a 15-minute mix that matches your venue's vibe from last Saturday night. Would you be open to a 5-minute call this week to discuss your upcoming March dates?

Best regards,
Sarah K

**The Follow-Up Strategy**

If you don't hear back in 5-7 days (which is normal), send this follow-up:

**Subject:** Re: March 15th Availability - DJ Sarah K

Hi Marcus,

I know you're swamped with bookings, so just wanted to bump this to the top of your inbox. Still have March 15th available and would love to contribute to another incredible Saturday at LIV.

Quick question - what's your preferred method for receiving DJ submissions? Email, phone, or in-person?

Thanks for your time,
Sarah

**Pro Tips for Email Success:**

1. **Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm** - Best response rates
2. **Research the person's name** - Never use "To Whom It May Concern"
3. **Keep it under 150 words** - They're busy people
4. **Always attach something** - Mix, press kit, or photos
5. **Use professional email address** - yourname@gmail.com, not partydj420@yahoo.com

**Common Mistakes That Kill Your Chances:**

‚ùå **Too Long** - Nobody reads 5-paragraph emails
‚ùå **Generic** - Same email to 50 venues is obvious
‚ùå **Desperate tone** - "Please give me a chance" energy
‚ùå **No research** - Shows you don't care about their venue
‚ùå **Attachment overload** - One mix, not your entire catalog
‚ùå **Typos and errors** - Instant delete
‚ùå **Following up too soon** - Wait at least 5 days

**Your Action Steps:**

1. **Research 10 venues** in your target market this week
2. **Find the booking contact** for each (name, email, social media)
3. **Study their resident DJs** and music style
4. **Write 3 custom emails** using this template
5. **Send them Tuesday-Thursday between 10am-2pm**
6. **Track responses** and refine your approach

**Success Metrics to Track:**

- **Open rates** (use email tracking tools)
- **Response rates** (aim for 15-20% minimum)
- **Meeting requests** (phone calls or in-person meetings)
- **Trial bookings** (your foot in the door)

Remember: This isn't about begging for gigs. You're offering a professional service that solves their problems. Approach it like the business transaction it is, and watch your response rates skyrocket.

## **Module 2: The Promo Pack That Gets Opened**
### *"What Promoters Actually Look For (It's Not What You Think)"*

---

**The $10,000 Promo Pack Mistake**

Last month, a DJ named Alex spent $10,000 on professional photos, studio time, and graphic design for his promo pack. It looked incredible - like something you'd see for a headlining artist.

Result? Zero bookings in 6 weeks.

Meanwhile, Jessica put together her promo pack using her iPhone and free Canva templates. She booked 8 gigs in the same period.

The difference? Jessica understood what promoters actually want to see.

**The Truth About Promo Packs**

Here's what most DJs don't realize: Promoters aren't art critics. They're business people with one question: *"Will this DJ help me make money?"*

They don't care about your artistic vision. They care about:
- Can you pack the floor?
- Will people stay and buy drinks?
- Are you reliable and professional?
- Do you bring your own audience?

**The Standard Promo Pack (That Doesn't Work)**

95% of DJs send packages that look like this:

üìÑ **Generic Bio:** "DJ Mike has been passionate about music since age 12. He loves bringing people together through the power of electronic dance music..."

üéµ **Random Mix:** 60-minute bedroom recording with no crowd noise

üì∏ **Blurry Photos:** Selfies or photos from 2018

üìä **No Social Proof:** Maybe some follower counts

**Result:** Instant delete.

**The Booking-Winning Promo Pack System**

Your promo pack needs exactly 5 components. No more, no less:

**Component 1: The Power Bio (2-3 sentences max)**

Your bio isn't your life story. It's a business case for why they should book you.

**Power Bio Formula:**
[DJ NAME] has [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT] across [LOCATION] for [TIME PERIOD], specializing in [GENRE/STYLE]. Known for [SPECIFIC SKILL], [he/she] has [CREDIBILITY MARKERS] and regularly [AUDIENCE/REACH PROOF].

**Examples of Effective Power Bios:**

*Tech House DJ:*
"DJ Sarah has packed dance floors across Miami's club scene for 3 years, specializing in tech house and progressive. Known for reading crowds and maintaining peak energy, she's held residencies at LIV and Story, and regularly draws 2,000+ followers to her monthly events."

*Wedding DJ:*
"DJ Michael has created unforgettable experiences for 200+ weddings across California, specializing in multi-generational crowd reading. Known for seamless transitions between genres, he maintains a 100% client satisfaction rate and books 18 months in advance."

*Festival DJ:*
"DJ Luna has ignited main stages across the Southwest festival circuit, specializing in bass-heavy electronic and crowd interaction. Known for high-energy performances, she's headlined Ultra Music Festival's rising talent stage and commands audiences of 10,000+."

**Power Bio Mistakes to Avoid:**
‚ùå "Passionate about music since childhood"
‚ùå "Loves bringing people together"
‚ùå "Started DJing in my bedroom"
‚ùå "Influenced by [famous DJ names]"
‚ùå Long paragraphs about musical journey

**Component 2: The Strategic Mix**

This is where 90% of DJs lose the booking. They send the wrong type of mix entirely.

**What NOT to Send:**
- 60+ minute bedroom recordings
- Warm-up or chill sets
- Experimental or artistic mixes
- Low-energy progressive builds
- Mixes without crowd noise

**What TO Send: The "Peak Hour Proof" Mix**

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes maximum
**Energy Level:** Peak hour only (no warm-up tracks)
**Recording:** Live with crowd noise when possible
**Content:** Matches their venue's exact vibe
**Quality:** Professional sound, no amateur mistakes

**The Peak Hour Proof Formula:**

**Minutes 1-3:** Hook them immediately
- Open with a track that matches their venue
- Show your mixing skills right away
- Build energy from second one

**Minutes 4-8:** Prove your crowd control
- Include crowd-pleasing moments
- Show genre versatility within their style
- Demonstrate seamless transitions

**Minutes 9-12:** Peak energy showcase
- Your biggest crowd reaction moment
- Technical skill highlight
- Memorable finale that leaves them wanting more

**Venue-Specific Mix Strategy:**

*For Nightclubs:* Record during actual peak hours (12am-2am energy)
*For Lounges:* Sophisticated house, no hard drops
*For Weddings:* Show genre transitions (hip-hop to pop to dance)
*For Festivals:* High energy, crowd interaction, hands-in-air moments

**Component 3: Social Proof Package**

Promoters book DJs who can prove they deliver results. Your social proof package needs 3 elements:

**Element 1: Visual Proof**
- Photos of packed dance floors (even from small gigs)
- Videos of crowds dancing to your music
- Screenshots of positive comments/reviews
- Images showing you actually performing

**Element 2: Testimonial Proof**
Collect these from every gig, no matter how small:

*From Venue Owners:*
"Sarah kept our dance floor packed all night. Sales were up 30% compared to last Saturday." - Marcus, LIV Miami

*From Event Organizers:*
"Mike had guests dancing from the first song to the last. Three people asked for his contact info." - Jennifer, Wedding Planner

*From Other DJs:*
"Luna's energy is infectious. She had the crowd eating out of her hand." - DJ Alex Martinez

**Element 3: Metric Proof**
- Social media follower counts (if impressive)
- Streaming numbers on mixes
- Event attendance figures
- Repeat booking percentages

**Component 4: The Professional Photo**

You need exactly ONE professional photo. Not a photoshoot - one perfect image.

**What Makes a Booking-Winning DJ Photo:**

‚úÖ **Behind the decks** - Shows you actually DJ
‚úÖ **Crowd visible** - Proves you can pack floors
‚úÖ **High resolution** - Looks professional in marketing
‚úÖ **Action shot** - Mid-performance, not posed
‚úÖ **Good lighting** - Clear, vibrant, energetic
‚úÖ **Brand consistent** - Matches your DJ persona

**Photo Mistakes That Hurt Bookings:**
‚ùå Selfies or friend photos
‚ùå Blurry/dark images
‚ùå Photos without DJ equipment
‚ùå Overly edited/filtered images
‚ùå Group photos where you're unclear
‚ùå Photos from years ago

**DIY Professional Photo Tips:**
- Have a friend with a good camera shoot during an actual gig
- Use your phone's portrait mode for background blur
- Golden hour lighting (sunset) works best
- Take 100+ shots to get 1 perfect one
- Include crowd reactions in the background

**Component 5: The Contact Package**

Make it easy for them to book you:

**Essential Contact Info:**
- Professional email address
- Phone number (responds quickly)
- Instagram handle (active, professional)
- Website or SoundCloud link

**Optional but Powerful:**
- Calendar booking link
- Rate sheet (for certain venues)
- Rider or technical requirements
- Additional mix links

## **Module 3: The Venue Research Method**
### *"How to Find the Right Gigs (And Avoid Wasting Time)"*

---

**The $5,000 Mistake Most DJs Make**

Last year, a talented DJ named Ryan spent $5,000 on Facebook ads promoting his "versatile DJ services" to "all event types in the city."

Result? 3 low-paying gigs and a drained bank account.

Meanwhile, his friend Lisa spent $200 on targeted research tools and booked 15 high-paying gigs by focusing on exactly the right venues for her style.

The difference? Lisa understood venue hierarchy and market positioning.

**Why Most DJs Target the Wrong Gigs**

Here's the brutal truth: Not every gig is worth your time. In fact, taking the wrong gigs can actually hurt your career progression.

**Gigs That Hurt Your Brand:**
- Venues that don't match your style/image

- Facebook Events in your area (sort by music/nightlife)
- Eventbrite and Meetup searches
- Local entertainment magazines and blogs
- Google Maps searches for venues in your genre

**What to Document:**
- Venue names and addresses
- Types of events they host
- Music genres they book
- Typical crowd size and demographics
- Event frequency and scheduling patterns

**Step 2: Decision Maker Identification**

For each venue, you need to find the right person to contact:

**The Hierarchy:**
1. **Talent Buyer/Booking Manager** (Best contact)
2. **Event Promoter** (Often external contractor)
3. **General Manager** (Final decision authority)
4. **Resident DJ** (Can provide introductions)
5. **Social Media Manager** (Can direct you to right person)

**Research Methods:**
- Check venue website staff directory
- Look at LinkedIn for employees
- Instagram stories often tag staff members
- Ask bartenders/security during visits
- Network with other DJs who've played there

**Step 3: Booking Pattern Analysis**

Study their booking behaviors:

**Questions to Answer:**
- How far in advance do they book?
- Do they prefer local or imported talent?
- What's their typical DJ fee range?
- Do they book the same DJs repeatedly?
- What nights/times do they use external DJs?

**Analysis Methods:**
- Track their social media posts for 4-6 weeks
- Note DJ announcements and frequency
- Check if DJs mention their fees on social media
- Look for patterns in genres and styles
- Identify their peak booking seasons

**Step 4: Competition Assessment**

Understand who you're competing against:

**Track Your Local Competition:**
- DJs who regularly play at your target venues
- Their follower counts and engagement rates
- Their performance fees (if publicly mentioned)
- Their booking frequency and venue types
- Their brand positioning and unique selling points

**Competitive Positioning:**
- What makes you different/better?
- What gaps exist in the current market?
- How can you complement (not compete with) current residents?
- What unique value do you bring to venues?

**The Venue Opportunity Scorecard**

Rate each potential venue on these factors (1-10 scale):

**Alignment Factors:**
- **Genre Match** - How well does their music match your style?
- **Crowd Fit** - Does their demographic match your target audience?
- **Brand Alignment** - Does their venue image match your DJ persona?
- **Time Slots** - Do they have openings during your preferred times?

**Business Factors:**
- **Pay Range** - Do they offer rates that meet your current tier?
- **Professionalism** - Do they treat DJs well and pay on time?
- **Growth Potential** - Could this lead to better opportunities?
- **Network Value** - Will this connect you with other industry contacts?

**Practical Factors:**
- **Accessibility** - Can you easily get there with your equipment?
- **Technical Setup** - Do they have adequate sound and equipment?
- **Booking Frequency** - How often could you realistically play there?
- **Competition Level** - How difficult will it be to get booked?

**Total Score: ___/80**

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 65-80: Priority target, pursue aggressively
- 50-64: Good opportunity, include in regular outreach
- 35-49: Low priority, contact only if time allows
- Below 35: Skip entirely

**Research Tools and Resources**

**Status Categories:**
- **Research** - Still gathering information

‚ùå **One-Time Research** - Not staying updated on venue changes

## **Module 4: The Networking Multiplication Effect**
### *"How One Connection Leads to 10 Gigs"*

---

**The Connection That Changed Everything**

Two years ago, DJ Marcus was struggling to book gigs despite having incredible technical skills. Then he met Sarah, a nightlife photographer, at a random Tuesday night event.

He didn't pitch her. He didn't ask for favors. He simply complimented her work and asked about her favorite venues to shoot.

That conversation led to:
- 3 club introductions within a month
- Professional photos for his press kit
- Referrals to 2 event promoters
- A regular monthly residency
- Over $15,000 in bookings in year one

**The secret?** Marcus understood that networking isn't about collecting contacts - it's about building genuine relationships that create mutual value.

**The Networking Hierarchy That Multiplies Opportunities**

Most DJs think networking means talking to other DJs. That's level 1 thinking. Here's the strategic hierarchy that creates exponential opportunities:

**Level 1: Other DJs (Your Referral Network)**
*Value: Direct gig referrals, collaboration opportunities, industry knowledge*

**What They Provide:**
- Sub opportunities when they can't make gigs
- Collaboration on events and parties
- Knowledge about venue preferences and booking contacts
- Social media cross-promotion and audience sharing
- Technical tips and skill development

**How to Approach:**
- Support their events by attending and promoting
- Share their mixes on your social media platforms
- Offer to cover their gigs when they're unavailable
- Propose collaboration on events or online content
- Ask for advice rather than favors

**Level 2: Photographers & Videographers (Your Content Creators)**
*Value: Professional content, venue connections, promotional opportunities*

**Why They're Networking Gold:**
- They work at different venues every weekend
- They know all the promoters, managers, and other DJs
- They create the content you need for marketing
- They often get asked "do you know any good DJs?"
- They understand the visual brand aspect of your career

**How to Connect:**
- Compliment their work at events (be specific)
- Share and tag their photos when you appear in them
- Offer to promote their services to other DJs
- Hire them for a small project to start the relationship
- Introduce them to other industry contacts you have

**Level 3: Promoters & Event Organizers (Your Opportunity Multipliers)**
*Value: Multiple booking opportunities, industry connections, event insights*

**What Makes Them Valuable:**
- They book multiple DJs for different types of events
- They have relationships with venue owners across the city
- They understand crowd demographics and preferences
- They're always seeking fresh, reliable talent
- They often work with the same vendors and contacts repeatedly

**Building Relationships:**
- Attend their events as a paying customer first
- Promote their events on social media without being asked
- Bring friends to their parties to boost attendance
- Offer to help with event logistics or promotion
- Be genuinely interested in their business success

**Level 4: Venue Owners & Managers (Your Decision Makers)**
*Value: Direct booking authority, industry influence, long-term partnerships*

**Why They're the Ultimate Network:**
- They have final authority on bookings and rates
- They know owners and managers at other venues
- They can offer regular residencies and partnerships
- They understand the business economics of hiring DJs
- They influence the local scene's direction and trends

**Strategic Approach:**
- Become a regular customer before pitching services
- Understand their business challenges and customer base
- Offer solutions beyond just DJ services
- Build personal relationships through consistent, professional interactions
- Demonstrate how you can contribute to their venue's success

**The Networking Action Plan: From Stranger to Advocate**
