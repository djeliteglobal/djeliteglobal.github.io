export const FAQS: FaqItem[] = [
    { question: "I don't have natural talent. Will this work for me?", answer: "Talent is a myth. DJing is a skill that can be learned by anyone willing to put in the work. This course focuses on technique, strategy, and mindset - all learnable skills. Many of our most successful students started with zero experience." },
    { question: "It's too expensive. Is it really worth the investment?", answer: "What's the cost of NOT taking action? One professional gig pays for the entire course. Our students average $2,000+ per gig after completing the program. This is an investment in your future, not an expense." },
    { question: "Will this work for my music genre?", answer: "Absolutely. The principles taught in DJ Elite work across all genres - house, techno, hip-hop, EDM, and more. The networking strategies, business skills, and performance techniques are universal to professional DJing." },
    { question: "I don't have time to dedicate to this.", answer: "The program is designed for busy people. Just 30 minutes a day for 90 days is all you need. The mobile app lets you practice anywhere, and the modules are bite-sized for easy consumption. If you have time to scroll social media, you have time to transform your DJ career." },
    { question: "What if I don't get results?", answer: "That's impossible if you follow the system. But if for any reason you don't land your first professional gig within 90 days, I'll refund every penny. No questions asked. The risk is entirely on me." },
    { question: "How is this different from YouTube tutorials?", answer: "YouTube gives you random tips. DJ Elite gives you a complete system. It's the difference between scattered puzzle pieces and a complete roadmap. Plus, you get personal mentorship, a community of peers, and proven strategies that actually work in the real world." },
